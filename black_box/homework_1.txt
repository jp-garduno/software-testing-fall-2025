Boundary Value Analysis

1. Function that calculates the eligibility of a person for a loan based on their income and credit score.
   The eligibility rules are as follows:
   - If the income is less than $30,000, the person is not eligible for a loan.
   - If the income is between $30,000 and $60,000 (inclusive) and the credit score is above 700, the person is eligible for a standard loan.
   - If the income is between $30,000 and $60,000 (inclusive) and the credit score is below or equal to 700, the person is eligible for a secured loan.
   - If the income is greater than $60,000 and the credit score is above 750, the person is eligible for a premium loan.
   - If the income is greater than $60,000 and the credit score is between 700 and 750 (inclusive), the person is eligible for a standard loan.
   Income < 30,000 → Not eligible

   30,000 >= Income <= 60,000 AND Credit > 700 Standard loan
   30,000 >= Income <= 60,000 AND Credit <= 700 Secured loan

   Income > 60,000 AND Credit > 750 Premium loan
   Income > 60,000 AND credit >= 700 AND credit <= 750 Standard loan

2. Function that determines the category of a product in an e-commerce system based on its price.
   The product categories and pricing rules are as follows:
   - Category A: Products priced between $10 and $50 (inclusive).
   - Category B: Products priced between $51 and $100 (inclusive).
   - Category C: Products priced between $101 and $200 (inclusive).
   - Category D: Products priced above $200.
   Price < 10 No category (Invalid/Out of range)
   10 >= Price <= 50 Category A
   51 >= Price <= 100 Category B
   101 >= Price <= 200 Category C
   Price > 200 Category D

3. Function that calculates the cost of shipping for packages based on their weight and dimensions.
   The shipping cost rules are as follows:
   - If the weight of the package is less than or equal to 1 kg and the dimensions (length, width, and height) are each less than or equal to 10 cm, the cost is $5.
   - If the weight is between 1 and 5 kg (inclusive) and the dimensions are each between 11 and 30 cm (inclusive), the cost is $10.
   - If the weight is greater than 5 kg or any of the dimensions is greater than 30 cm, the cost is $20.
   Weight <= 1 kg AND all dimensions <= 10 cm $5

   Weight > 1 AND Weight <= 5 AND all dimensions > 10 cm AND dimension <= 30 cm $10

   Weight > 5 kg OR any dimension > 30 cm $20

Decision Table

1. Create the decision table for a system that provides weather advisories based on temperature and humidity.
   The rules are:
   - Weather recommendation "High temperature and humidity. Stay hydrated." for temperature > 30 and humidity > 70.
   - Weather recommendation "Low temperature. Don't forget your jacketA 3!" for temperature < 0 and any humidity.
   - No weather recommendation for any other temperature and humidity combination.

   Condition   temperature high > 30    temperature low < 0    humidity High > 70   Advisory
   R1          yes                      no                     yes                  High temperature and humidity. Stay hydrated.
   R2          no                       yes                    any                  Low temperature. Don't forget your Jacket
   R3          no                       no                     any                  No advisory

2. Create the decision table for a system that authenticates users based on their username and password.
   The rules are:
   - Returns "Admin" for username "admin" and password "admin123".
   - Returns "User" for any other username with at least 5 characters and password with at least 8 characters.
   - Returns "Invalid" if the username or password lenghts are not met.

   Condition   Username = Admin   username length > 4   password is admin123   password length > 7   Result
   R1          yes                -                     yes                    -                     Admin
   R2          no                 yes                   no                     yes                   User
   R3          any                no                    any                    any                   Invalid
   R4          any                any                   any                    no                    Invalid

State Transition

1. Draw the state transition diagram for a simple vending machine that dispenses drinks.
   - It has two states: "Ready" and "Dispensing".
   - Goes from Ready to Dispensing when inserting a coin and asks you to select the drink.
   - After selecting the drink, thanks you and goes from Dispensing to Ready.

   [Ready] -- insert coin --> [Dispensing] -- select drink/thank you --> [Ready]

2. Draw the state transition diagram for an elevator system.
   - The states are "Idle", "Moving Up" and "Moving Down".
   - The elevator can only move up or down if the state is in "Idle" state.
   - The elevator can only stop if the state is either "Moving Down" or "Moving Up"

   State = Idle AND Command up -> State changes to Moving Up
   State = Idle AND Command down -> State changes to Moving Down
   State = Moving Up AND Arrive/stop -> State changes to Idle
   State = Moving Down AND Arrive/stop -> State changes to Idle
